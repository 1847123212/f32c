# Universal make

This makefile is recommended as template for all builds from linux.
It uses the same source base for building all bitstream formats for all
boards, all FPGA sizes, all SOCs etc., just by editing simple makefile
which does the magic.

It makes build workflow significantly faster than using diamond GUI alone.
