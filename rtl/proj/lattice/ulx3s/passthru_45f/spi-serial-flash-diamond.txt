Programming Flash from Diamond GUI
using ft2232 cable connected to JTAG header

flash can also slowly programmed from commandline with
ft231x usbserial using make program_flea_flash

Onboard flash chip is: IS25LP032D-JNLE-TR SOIC-8 150mil

Connect FT2232 cable to JTAG header, make first upload of any SVF using
openocd to prime the cable for diamond use

follow TN02050 to generate PROM file and go to section
6. Programming the SPI Flash with bitstream file using Diamond Programmer

Open diamond, select tools->Spreadsheet view, enable master SPI port and
MCCLK 62 MHz, double click xcf file

SYSCONFIG CONFIG_IOVOLTAGE=3.3 COMPRESS_CONFIG=ON SLAVE_SPI_PORT=DISABLE MASTER_SPI_PORT=ENABLE SLAVE_PARALLEL_PORT=DISABLE ;
